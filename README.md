This repository contains code of face emotion recognition that was developed in the RSF (Russian Science Foundation) project no. 20-71-10010 (Efficient audiovisual analysis of dynamical changes in emotional state based on information-theoretic approach).

Our approach is described in the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17107) published at [IEEE SISY 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9582508). The extended version of this paper is under considereation in the international journal.

All the models were pre-trained for face identification task using [VGGFace2 dataset](https://github.com/ox-vgg/vgg_face2). In order to train PyTorch models, [SAM code](https://github.com/davda54/sam) was borrowed.

We upload several [models](models/affectnet_emotions) that obtained the state-of-the-art results for [AffectNet dataset](http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/). The facial features extracted by these models lead to the state-of-the-art accuracy of face-only models on video datasets from EmotiW [2019](https://sites.google.com/view/emotiw2019), [2020](https://sites.google.com/view/emotiw2020) challenges: [AFEW (Acted Facial Expression In The Wild)](https://cs.anu.edu.au/few/AFEW.html), [VGAF (Video level Group AFfect)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8925231) and [EngageWild](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8615851).

Here are the accuracies measure on the testing set of above-mentioned datasets:

| Model | AffectNet (8 classes), original | AffectNet (8 classes), aligned  | AffectNet (7 classes), original   | AffectNet (7 classes), aligned   | AFEW  | VGAF  |
| :---:   | :-: | :-:  | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [mobilenet_7.h5](models/affectnet_emotions/mobilenet_7.h5) | -  |  -  | 64.71   |  -  | 55.35 | 68.92  |
| [enet_b0_8_best_afew.pt](models/affectnet_emotions/enet_b0_8_best_afew.pt) | 60.95  | 60.18  | 64.63  | 64.54   | 59.89  | 66.80  |
| [enet_b0_8_best_vgaf.pt](models/affectnet_emotions/enet_b0_8_best_vgaf.pt) | 61.32   | 61.03  | 64.57   | 64.89   | 55.14  | 68.29  |
| [enet_b0_7.pt](models/affectnet_emotions/enet_b0_7.pt) | -    | - | 65.74   | 65.74   | 56.99  | 65.18  |
| [enet_b2_8.pt](models/affectnet_emotions/enet_b2_8.pt) | 63.025  | 62.40  | 66.29 | -   | 57.78  | 70.23  |
| [enet_b2_7.pt](models/affectnet_emotions/enet_b2_7.pt) | -    | - | 65.91   | 66.34   | 59.63  | 69.84  |

Please note, that we report the accuracies for AFEW and VGAFonly on the subsets, in which MTCNN detects facial regions. The code contains also computation of overall accuracy on the complete testing set, which is slightly lower due to the absence of faces or failed face detection.

In order to run our code on the datasets, please prepare them firstly using our TensorFlow notebooks: [train_emotions.ipynb](src/train_emotions.ipynb), [AFEW_train.ipynb](src/AFEW_train.ipynb) and [VGAF_train.ipynb](src/VGAF_train.ipynb).

If you want to run our mobile application, please, run the following scripts inside [mobile_app](mobile_app) folder:
```
python to_tflite.py
python to_pytorchlite.py
```

Please be sure that EfficientNet models for PyTorch are based on old timm 0.4.5 package, so that exactly tis version should be installed by the following command:
```
pip install timm==0.4.5
```
